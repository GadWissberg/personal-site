          I'm currently working as a fullstack developer at [Riskified.](https://riskified.com) in Tel-Aviv, Israel. My main responsibility is to develop and maintain microservices using Scala and Node.js in a real-time production environment. My work involves the entire software development lifecycle, from designing and refining services to coding, testing, and deploying new features. I also play a role as a shifter, ensuring smooth operations of the production environment for our SAAS products.

          To improve my backend development skills, I prioritize continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field. I attend conferences, take online courses, read blogs and books, and participate in online communities and forums. Additionally, I focus on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code by following best practices and writing unit tests and integration tests.

          Collaboration is key in my work, and I strive to communicate clearly and share knowledge and ideas with my team members. I use version control systems like Git to manage code changes and work collaboratively on code. To automate the development process and reduce manual processes, I use tools like CircleCI, Docker, and Kubernetes to automate build, test, and deployment processes.

          Continuous monitoring and analysis of service performance is essential to ensure optimal performance. I use monitoring tools like Coralogix, Grafana and Prometheus to collect metrics and visualize data, enabling me to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

          Java back-end development, using Spring Boot in a microservice architecture. Mostly object-oriented, but also
          developing in aspect-oriented. Development includes REST APIs, implementing features from the high-level
          design (including Swagger), through low-level design, implementation and writing tests (unit, component,
          integration and E2E) and also performing stress-tests (analyzing network, CPU, DB usage).

          Implementations include usage of MongoDB, taking into considerations major factors such as indexing, adding
          views in other microservices and optimized interactions with the DB. Also fair experience with OracleDB.
          Using and integrating Kafka for events distribution in a microservice environment. This includes analyzing and
          debugging Kafka integration with the product for an optimized performance.

          Handling support requests - Investigating product’s log files produced in the client’s machines in order to analyze,
          reproduce and fix bugs.

          Containerization - Working and deploying in Kubernetes for E2E tests, and viewing logs directly or Kibana. Using
          Docker and VM environments for component and stress tests. Also fair experience with AWS.

          Presenting demo sessions to relevant audiences for new features implemented by me and teammates.
          Leading integration for various features that require several microservices which are under the responsibility of
          other teams. These tasks require more communication with other teams, rather than concrete implementation.

          Development and deployment in Linux CentOS and Windows environments.
          Full teamwork in SAFe routine through each PI, mainly with developers, PMs and architects.
          Working with auxiliary development services such as Jira, Git, Gitlab and Jenkins.
